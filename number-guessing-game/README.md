# Number Guessing Game

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to build a number guessing game that challenges the user to identify a randomly selected number within a specified range. The game is designed to provide a fun and interactive experience, while also teaching the user about basic programming concepts.

## How to Play

To start the game, the user is prompted to enter a lower and an upper bound for the range of numbers (e.g., from A to B). The system then randomly selects an integer that falls within this user-defined interval. The user's task is to guess the chosen number using as few attempts as possible. After each guess, the game provides feedback to help the user refine their next guess.

## Gameplay

The game prompts the user to enter their guess by typing a number within the specified range. The system then compares the user's guess with the randomly selected number. Based on the comparison, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high or too low. The user continues making guesses until they correctly identify the randomly selected number.

## Conclusion

The number guessing game is a simple yet engaging application that demonstrates the basics of programming concepts such as input/output, conditional statements, and loops. It provides a fun and interactive experience, while also helping the user develop problem-solving skills.
